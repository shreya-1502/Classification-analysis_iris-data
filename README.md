# Dataset
The Iris dataset is a popular dataset in the field of machine learning and statistics. It is often used for practicing classification algorithms and is considered a beginner's dataset 
for learning purposes. The dataset is named after the iris flowers it represents, and it was introduced by the British biologist and statistician Ronald A. 
Fisher in 1936. The Iris dataset consists of measurements of four features for three species of iris flowers. The four features are:
Sepal Length: Length of the sepals (the outermost petal parts).
Sepal Width: Width of the sepals.
Petal Length: Length of the petals (the innermost petal parts).
Petal Width: Width of the petals

# SVM Algorithm 
Support Vector Machines (SVM) is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. In the context of classification, 
SVM is particularly powerful for handling both linear and non-linear datasets. 
The basic idea behind SVM is to find a hyperplane in a high-dimensional space that separates the data into classes.

# Logistic Regression
Logistic Regression is a commonly used algorithm for binary classification in machine learning. Despite its name, it's used for classification rather than regression. 
The logistic regression model predicts the probability that an instance belongs to a particular class.
